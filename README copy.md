# **AI Chatbot for Student Data Management**

## Overview

This project is an AI-driven chatbot fine-tuned with the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM model. It interacts with a dataset of fictional student information, answering questions about student profiles while handling both in-dataset and out-of-dataset queries. The chatbot is built with a **FastAPI** backend and a **React** frontend, ensuring seamless communication and efficient response handling. It also features chat history storage using **MongoDB**, with session persistence via local storage, and provides users with a dedicated history page for reviewing past interactions.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Responses**: Fine-tuned with student data using Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM to provide precise answers to queries.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Efficient API handling and scalable architecture for seamless server-client communication.
- **React Frontend**: Interactive user interface with real-time communication and response rendering.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores chat history dynamically, allowing real-time retrieval and review of previous conversations.
- **Local Storage**: Persists chat history across sessions for better user experience and continuity.
- **Dedicated History Page**: Displays a complete log of past conversations for easy reference.
- **In-Dataset and Out-of-Dataset Handling**: Accurately manages both known and unknown queries with appropriate responses.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (for chat history)
- **Model**: Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM (fine-tuned with student data)
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud SDK, Google AI Studio
- **Storage**: Local Storage (for session persistence)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Node.js and npm** (for React frontend)
- **MongoDB** (for storing chat history)
- **Google Cloud SDK** (for model fine-tuning and deployment)
- **FFmpeg** (for Flask backend audio handling)
- **Gemini API Key** and **Model ID**

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravOOO2/Fine_Tuned_Student_Data_AI_ChatBot_Backend.git
   cd Fine_Tuned_Student_Data_AI_ChatBot_Backend
   ```

   

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and add your credentials:

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravOOO2/Fine_Tuned_Student_Data_AI_ChatBot_FrontEnd.git

   ```

   ```bash
      cd Fine_Tuned_Student_Data_AI_ChatBot_FrontEnd
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### MongoDB Setup

1. **Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a connection URI.** The chat history is stored dynamically in MongoDB.
2. **Set the MongoDB URI in the backend's `.env` file.**

### Model Fine-Tuning

1. **Fine-tune the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM** using **Google Cloud SDK** and **AI Studio**. The dataset used contains fictional student information in JSON format.

2. **Model ID and API Key** should be included in the `.env` file.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the chatbot by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

1. **Chat with the Bot**: Ask questions about students, and the chatbot will respond using the fine-tuned Gemini model.
2. **Chat History**: Check the "History" tab to view past conversations.
3. **Session Persistence**: The chatbot will remember past conversations using local storage.

## Example Queries

- "What is the age of John Doe?"
- "Who is Jane Smith's oncologist?"
- "Which school does Alex attend?"
- "What is the percentage of Lily Thompson?"

For any out-of-dataset queries, the chatbot will gracefully handle them with appropriate fallback responses.
